05/06/16 - version 1.0 :
  help, verbose, quiet, end numbers, 13375P34|<, output, words, names and dates features implemented to begin with.

06/06/16 - version 1.1 :
  version and constrain features added.
  constrain feature allows speed improvements.
  bug fixed in dates that caused two-member lists to fail.

11/06/16 - version 1.2 :
  -f file and -t transforms options added.

13/06/16 - version 1.3 :
  added multithreading for generating permutations, significant speed improvements ensue.
  however, some repetitions get through as well - since this is just a speed improvement, you may want to stick to 1.2 for now, as the tool you feed the wordlist to is probably taking longer over each 
word.
  the -q flag now actually suppresses the banner.
